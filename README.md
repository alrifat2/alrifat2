### Hi there 👋
I'm Al, a senior majoring in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo. I work with JavaScript and Python at the moment, but starting to love building cool things in Rust! 

💼 Worked in the Site Reliability team as a Software Engineer Intern building an internal monitoring pipeline for [Optum, Inc.](https://www.optum.com/) in Summer 2024 and also worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Optum creating internal tools under the ACET team in Summer 2023<br>
💻 Previously worked at [Seidenberg Creative Labs](http://seidenbergcreativelabs.com/) creating awesome projects for our clients <br>
🙋 I am always open to **Software Engineering internship opportunities** with a great team that will help me grow as an engineer and, ideally, as a person <br>
